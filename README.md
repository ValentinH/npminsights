# npminsights.com

The original idea behind this website was too generate images containing download metrics in order to display them on Github Readmes.
In order to have something to link to when clicking the image, a website was created as well.

## Development

This is using Next.js 13 with the new `app` directory architecture.

To install the dependencies:
```sh
yarn install
```

To run the app:
```sh
yarn dev
```
